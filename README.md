# Simple Calculator (HTML & CSS Only)

A basic, static calculator designed using **HTML** and **CSS**. This version of the calculator does not include JavaScript, meaning it lacks functionality for performing real arithmetic operations. The project is focused on the design and layout of the calculator interface.

## Features

- Basic layout with buttons for digits (0-9), arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), and clear functionality.
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop views.
- Clean, simple UI with modern styles.
